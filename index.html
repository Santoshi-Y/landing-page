									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>Hey! I'm Santoshi and I'm a senior in high school living in Illinois! I'm passionate about CS and Math research and I can't wait to dive deeper into those fields in college. Apart from that, I'm on a mission to inspire more young girls to pursue careers in STEM, which is why I started my podcast, STEM Heroines Podcast. I'm always looking for ways to use my tech skills to improve other peoples' lives! I hope you enjoy my projects!</p>

									<h3>Math Research Paper</h3>
									<p>I co-authored a math research paper called Classifying Critical Angles of Laplacian Eigenfunctions on a Square Membrane. We extended Antonie Stern's 1924 result by constructing eigenfunctions on a square with exactly m nodal domains, for any even m. We also explored conjectures for cases when m is odd. I am currently working independently with my mentor on constructing a sequence of Neumann-Laplacian eigenfunctions on the flat torus with an equal number of nodal domains, which has not been proven before. I have been selected to present at LSU Undergrad Research Discovery Day 2025.</p>

									<h3>Bioinformatics Projects</h3>
									<p>I am a Bioinformatics Researcher at the RNA Institute in the University at Albany. My first research project was on Differential Gene Expression Analysis and Alternative Splicing Analysis of Tibilais Anterior Muscle Samples from DM1 patients and control patients. My second research project is on Identifying Differentially Expressed Genes in SCA2 Patients' White Blood Cell Samples that can be used as Biomarkers in Therapy Development and to Diagnose Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2. I used the R programming language for analysis. I am researching under mentorship of UAlbany faculty member, Hannah Shorrock. I am going to present my poster at in-person UAlbany RNA Day Symposium.</p>

									<h3>AI+Criminal Justice</h3>
									<p>I gained experience in python, machine learning, and neural networks. Worked on an AI project with a mentor from Stanford and three other students. For the project, we used AI, python, and machine learning to solve the ethical problem of racial bias in the race assessment tool that the justice system uses to figure out if the defendant will recidivate in two years.</p>

									<h3>Coding the Future: Intro to Python</h3>
									<p>For the past 2 summers, I've been working on a 200 page that aims to educate young, underprivilaged children on how to code using Python. It will be ready for publication in a month!</p>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-link"></span>
									<h3>Deep Learning Research Project</h3>
									<p>I am currently working on writing a paper on the Comparative Analysis of Different Deep Learning Architectures for the Prediction of Down syndrome Using Images. I will be publishing the paper in a high school journal.</p>

									<h3>5 AI Projects in 5 weeks!</h3>
									<p>I am currently a Software Engineering Fellow at Headstarter AI. I am completing 5 AI applications(Personal Website, AI Pantry Tracker, AI Customer Support, AI Flashcards & Stripe, AI Rate My Professor) in 5 weeks. I am working on a final AI app which I will be pitching to engineers and reach 1000+ users. These are the tech skills I learned and am using for my projects: HTML, CSS, DNS, ReactJS, NextJS, Firebase, OpenAI, AWS, Auth, StripeAPI, RAG, Vectors, UI</p>
